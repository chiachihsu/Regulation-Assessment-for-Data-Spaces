# Regulation-Assessment-for-Data-Spaces

The aim of the project is to develop a tool to ease data compliance tasks. 
In the framework of Common European Data Spaces, data needs to be assessed in terms of its compliance with new relevant EU regulations and policies. 
The tool would provide comprehensive reports and recommendations to help organizations ensure that their data spaces meet the necessary regulatory standards.

The objective of the system is to guide the user towards discovering the legal obligations derived from the data/AI operations made.
The system has the form of a wizard-like tool, where the user answers questions in a series of steps, and gets a report in the last step depending on the given answers.
We claim that a general tool is possible, where the logic is detached from the actual questions and results.
In order to make this tool general, a decision tree parser will be programmed. The logic of the system may be encoded in BPMN (flow of the decision tree), which can be encoded as XML (BPEL).
